Hi Platziers! Thanks for this wonderful opportunity. Let's do it! I will give you some information to give a better idea of where we want to reach.

<b>Context:</b> We have seen the rise of interest in crypto currencies here, in the Latin America region. Many new crypto brokers are starting operations and new coins being offered in the region. However, to have information, even for basic operations, is very painful. For example, if I want to buy 100 ETH, where is the cheapest place to buy in Mexico? Or which brokers have the lower fees? Only in Brazil we have more than 40 brokers, and most of them only let you see the full information after creating an account.

<b>About us and the MVP:</b> Initially, we developed the platform for our own use (we do arbitrage), so we didn't expect to offer it publicly, however, after a deep research in Latin America region, we found that our tools are really necessary. So we are developing the MVP platform for the Latam market, that consist of the following basic features: users will see the buy and sell prices from 5 coins (bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoincash and stellar) and from 10 international brokers from the region (satoshitango, cryptomkt, mercadobitcoin, bitpreco, etc), also they will see the orders book and the last executions on the orders book. All this information in one place.

<b>Initial challenges:</b> We don't have a website yet, so you can feel free to use the color schema, fonts, and layout you find suitable for this project. We only want you to consider these three points to sell:

- Since the crypto world is presented as a dangerous activity (or related to virtual crimes) in many news, the very first value we want to show to our potential user is Trust and Confidence, in order to create authority.
- Our platform will gather information from many places in only one. So our users will have an intelligence platform that will allow them to spend less time, have the right information at the right moment, and as a consequence, make wise decisions to make more money.
- We will offer a USD 19 monthly plan and a USD 99 annual plan.

<b>Long term goal:</b> We aim to be the place where every crypto investor will use to have useful information and tools in order to improve their operations.

Hope this information will help you to have a broad understanding of our project.
Any other information you want, please, let me know.
